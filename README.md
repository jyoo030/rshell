# Rshell

## Description

This project was to create a basic shell using C++. It has basic shell functionality, such as running commands with and without the connectors &&, ||, and ;. It has since been updated to include cd functionality as well as integration of parenthesis. 

##List of Known Bugs:
	* When enter is pressed on an empty line, it tries to input that as a command and reprint the $. 
	* When you input 'test', it takes it in as a command but doesn't output an error. 
	* When you leave an empty command it doesn't return an error (ls &&)
